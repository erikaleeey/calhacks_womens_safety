# 🎙️ Voice Agent Integration Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done

I successfully integrated the LiveKit voice agent from your `aspen_agent` app into your main `womens-safety-app`. Here's what changed:

### 1. **Copied Components & Hooks**
- ✅ Copied `useConnectionDetails` hook (hooks/useConnectionDetails.ts)
- ✅ Copied `useDataStreamTranscriptions` hook (hooks/useDataStreamTranscriptions.ts)
- ✅ Copied all voice agent UI components:
  - `AgentVisualization.tsx`
  - `ChatBar.tsx`
  - `ChatLog.tsx`
  - `ControlBar.tsx`

### 2. **Created Voice Assistant Screen**
- ✅ Created new screen at `app/voice-assistant.tsx`
- ✅ Full voice assistant interface with:
  - Voice visualization
  - Chat interface
  - Mic/camera/screen share controls
  - Exit button to return to home

### 3. **Updated Home Screen**
- ✅ Added clean, simple UI with "Talk to Safety Agent" button
- ✅ Button navigates to voice assistant when pressed

### 4. **Configured LiveKit**
- ✅ Created `.env` file with your existing LiveKit credentials
- ✅ Sandbox ID: `cloudy-opcode-1lfiyj`
- ✅ Server URL: `wss://calhackswomensafety-wvtvsqg1.livekit.cloud`

### 5. **Installed Dependencies**
- ✅ `expo-blur` - For UI effects
- ✅ `@livekit/components-react` - For voice assistant components

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart the Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

**Important:** You MUST restart after adding the `.env` file!

### Step 2: Run the App
Choose your platform:

**Web (easiest for testing):**
```bash
npm run web
# or press 'w' when the dev server is running
```

**iOS:**
```bash
npm run ios
# or press 'i' when the dev server is running
```

**Android:**
```bash
npm run android
# or press 'a' when the dev server is running
```

### Step 3: Test the Voice Agent
1. You should see the home screen with "Women's Safety App" title
2. At the bottom, there's a blue button: "🎙️ Talk to Safety Agent"
3. Press the button
4. The voice assistant screen should open
5. Grant microphone permissions when prompted

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Home Screen
- Clean white background
- Header: "Women's Safety App"
- Map placeholder in the center
- Blue button at the bottom

### Voice Assistant Screen
- Black background
- Agent visualization (animated bars when speaking)
- Chat log showing conversation transcriptions
- Control bar with mic/camera/exit buttons
- Mic should turn on/off when tapped

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed" or agent not appearing
1. **Check if LiveKit agent is running**
   - Your voice agent backend needs to be running
   - It should connect to the same room

2. **Verify credentials**
   - Check `.env` file exists and has correct values
   - Sandbox ID should be: `cloudy-opcode-1lfiyj`

3. **Restart dev server**
   - Stop with Ctrl+C
   - Run `npm start` again

### Microphone permissions
- **iOS/Android:** Grant permissions when prompted
- **Web:** Click "Allow" in browser prompt

### Build errors
If you get module not found errors:
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

## 🎤 Next Steps

### To make the voice agent work fully:

1. **Start your LiveKit agent backend**
   - The agent needs to be running and connected to room
   - Use the same credentials from `.env`

2. **Test the connection**
   - Open the app
   - Press "Talk to Safety Agent"
   - Check if it connects (loading indicator should appear)

3. **Speak to the agent**
   - Tap the microphone button (should turn white when active)
   - Speak and watch the agent visualization
   - Transcriptions should appear in the chat log

## 🔐 Security Note

Your `.env` file contains API credentials. Make sure it's in `.gitignore`:
```bash
# Check if .env is gitignored
cat .gitignore | grep .env
```

If not, add it:
```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```
